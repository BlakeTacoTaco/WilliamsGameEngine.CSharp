fish breeding

you have to feed fish

fish prices fluxuate based on global population

you can toss items in ocean for varied effects
	-car battery (electric eels unlocked)
	-plastic bags (kills off turtles)

net fishing

rod fishing

tackle fishing (literally)

fish can craft things for you

fish food chains exist

fish price kinda exponential because the more fish you buy the less there are in global population and the higher the price is.

limited buyers for fish so you can't just superinvest into one fish.

fish happiness
	-higher quality fish (sell for more)
	-craft faster and stuff
